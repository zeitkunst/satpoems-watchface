# EL 20 DEGREES

The earth slows the payload above the ground<br/>
Understand its name, "INTERCOSMOS 24"<br/>
Thrown to the heavens upon fire a long time ago<br/>
It will be reduced to dust.<br/>

#  Satellite Poems (On Your Wrist is the Universe)

The above poem come from a suite entitled *Satellite Poems: (On Your Wrist is the Universe)*. These poems are for the [Pebble smartwatch platform](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/593448abb67f9f814d0009c5) and are automatically generated based on what satellites are above the wearer at that time and place. The watch, when paired with one's phone, is able to know the wearer's location and time of day and thus predict what satellites are up above. By connecting with databases of known satellites, the app can determine what kind of satellite it is, when it was launched, and so on. These elements go into the generation of the poem.

All code for the generation of the poem is available here in Github.
